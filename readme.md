# WHAT IS IT?

This command line tool renames all the files in the specified folder.
This was not made recursive with subfolders due to some limitations with Python.


# HOW TO USE IT


## NOTE: The tool was made for personal use and was tested on Linux Manjaro but not on other platforms.

Error handling was not pushed very far since I use it for my personal needs.
As a result, you may encounter errors if you don't type what's expected.

Make sure you installed Python!


1) Download the project.
